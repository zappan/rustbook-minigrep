# Rust Book Minigrep Excercise

This is a `minigrep` excercise from the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
which I went through and played with that code alongside reading through the book. It
contains the trivial `grep` implementation in Rust, mainly following what the book
provided, though it may be slighly modified to satisfy my learning curiosity and trying
the extra possibilities of the language.

This is mostly intended to be a self-reference, but if anyone finds it interesting you
may freely use it for your own reference.
